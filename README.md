# Laptop Price Prediction Machine Learning Project

Welcome to the Laptop Price Prediction project! This project aims to predict the prices of laptops based on various features using machine learning techniques.


## Data

The dataset used in this project contains various features of laptops such as:

- Brand
- Model
- Processor type
- RAM size
- Storage size
- Screen size
- Operating system
- Price
- others


## Model

This project employs several machine learning algorithms to predict laptop prices. The models evaluated include:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor

The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics.

## Evaluation

The performance of the models is evaluated using the following metrics:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared (RÂ²)
